    "SIGN Encrypts and then signs the given input. On top of the requirements for the Encrypt action, signing requires senders to be set for user's email; and secretKey & secretPassword to be set to private key's path and it's password (password is optional, if private key does not have protection).",
    "DECRYPT Decrypts the given input. Requires secretKey and secretPassword to bet set to private key's path and it's password. Just like signing, password is not required, if private key does not have protection.",
    "VERIFY Decrypts and verifies the given input. On top of the requirements for the Decrypt action, verification expects list of senders' email's and corresponding public keys. However, sender emails does not have to be set, and in that case, this pipe will only validate that someone signed the input.",
