By choosing a listener, the Frank developer determines how the messages are received. For example, an org.frankframework.http.rest.ApiListener receives RESTful HTTP requests and a JavaListener receives messages from direct Java calls.\n\nApart from wrapping the listener, a Receiver can be configured to store received messages and to keep track of the processed / failed status of these messages.\n\nThere are two kinds of listeners: synchronous listeners and asynchronous listeners. Synchronous listeners are expected to return a response. The system that triggers the receiver typically waits for a response before proceeding "
