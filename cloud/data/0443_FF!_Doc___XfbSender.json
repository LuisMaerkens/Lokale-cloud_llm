Assumes sender input is local filename.\nSome comments from Richard Maddox (FTO) about UNIX File permissions:\n\nIn case of AIX or SUN systems we advise the following user and directory permissions:\n\nSENDING CFT:\n- App_user must have secondary group: xfbgw\n- Folder should have ownership: app_user:xfbgw (owner:group)\n- Folder should have access rights: 770 (rwx.rwx.---) so nobody other then app_user and group xfbgw can do something in this folder\n- Folder should have SGID bit set so that all files what is copied to this folder get group ownership xfbgw\n- send file must have rights 660 after putting the file in the send directory.\n\nRECEIVING CFT:\n- App_user (the application user of customer) should have secondary group: xfbgw\n- Folder should have ownership: app_user:xfbgw (owner:group)\n- Folder should have access"
