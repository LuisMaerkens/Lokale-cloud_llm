This feature is controlled by the transacted attribute. If this is set to true, received messages are committed or rolled back, possibly together with other actions, by the receiver or the pipeline. In case of a failure, all actions within the transaction are rolled back.\n\nSetting listener.acknowledgeMode to \"auto\" means that messages are allways acknowledged (removed from the queue, regardless of what the status of the Adapter is. \"client\" means that the message will only be removed from the queue when the state of the Adapter equals the success state for committing.
